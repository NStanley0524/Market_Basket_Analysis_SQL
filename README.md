# Market_Basket_Analysis_SQL
An analysis used to uncover relationships between items in a retail setting using Association rules.


## Introduction
Market Basket Analysis is a data mining technique used to uncover customer purchasing pattern. It looks to find what combination of products occur frequently in a transaction. It helps businesses and retailers to understand and ultimately serve their customers by predicting their purchasing behaviours. These relationships can help increase profitability through cross-selling, recommendations, promotions or simple placement of items on a menu or in a store. It answers the question **" How likely is it that a customer buys product B if he already has product A"**

The approach is based on the theory that customers who buy certain item (or group of items) are likely to also buy another item (or group of item). Take for instance: A Supermarket, If a customer buys a trouser, they are more likely to buy a shirt than someone that did not buy a trouser. 

So market basket analysis tells us which item or product are often bought together. So if a customer buys a trouser, how likley is it that this customer will allso buy a shirt, or shoe, or cap.
